In English, we have can break nouns up into three rough categories: 
- nouns that add "s" to form their plural version
- nouns that add "es" to form their plural version
- nouns that are unchanged in their plural version.

For example:
- to make the word "cat" plural, we add "s", to form "cats"
- to make the word "bus" plural, we add "es", to form "buses"
- to make the word "sheep" plural, we leave it unchanged, as in: "oh look, a flock of sheep"

We can write some rules on how this pluralisation works:
- There is no hard and fast rule for which nouns should be left unchanged, but for the sake of this exercise, let's just say that there are only three nouns in that category - "fish", "sheep", and "bison".
- Leaving those three words aside, if the singular noun ends in â€‘s, -ss, -sh, -ch, -x, or -z, you should always add "es" to the end to make it plural.
- Otherwise add "s" to make the noun plural.

Your challenge is to write a program that will pluralise nouns for the user. To do this, write three functions:

- a _welcome function, that greets the user and explains that this is a pluralisation program
- a _pluralise function, which takes a string as argument, and returns it's plural form
- a _print_output function, that presents the plural form of the string to the user in a clear format

How you code these functions, and how you put them together to create your program is up to you! To test your code, try the following inputs, and see if you get the right output:

```fish -> fish
bison -> bison
sheep -> sheep
test -> tests
equation -> equations
dessert -> desserts
desert -> deserts
leg -> legs
stress -> stresses
brush -> brushes
lunch -> lunches
pontifex -> pontifexes
buzz -> buzzes```
